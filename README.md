# Sigil Generator!

![I have several passive income streams that allow me to be free](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc88a6b6-9a09-456c-ab3d-67815414ffb6)

## **Description**
**This Python project generates a symbolic sigil based on a given phrase by following a structured approach.**
<br>The script processes the input phrase, removes vowels and double consonants, maps letters to numbers, and creates a visual sigil representing the phrase.
<br>The generated sigil is saved as a PNG file.

## **Features**
- **Text Processing** : Removes vowels and double consonants from the input phrase.
- **Unicode Normalization** : Converts accented letters to their non-accented counterparts.
- **Mapping** : Assigns each remaining letter to a corresponding number.
- **Visualization** : Draws a square divided into 8 parts, places points, and connects them with lines to create the sigil.
- **Customizable Output** : Saves the generated sigil as a PNG file.

## **Prerequisites**
- **`Python 3.x`** installed on your machine
- **`Matplotlib`** library
- **`Numpy`** library

## **Installation Instructions**
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system before running the install command.

1. Clone this repository to your machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/0x414854/Create_Sigil.git

2. Install the required libraries.

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy

3. Customize the phrase variable in the script based on the phrase you want to generate a sigil for.

    ```python
    phrase = "Your phrase here"

5. You're ready to run the program!

   ```bash
   python3 sigil_generator.py    

## **Usage Examples**
- Run the Python script.
- The script will process the input phrase, generate a sigil, and save it as a PNG file in the "sigils" directory.
- The console will display the processed result and the number mapping for the phrase.
